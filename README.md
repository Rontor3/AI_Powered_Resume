provides a realistic ATS-friendliness score, and detailed improvement feedback.

Built to create an open, free, and powerful alternative to expensive resume evaluation platforms.

## 📢 Motivation

Most resume scoring platforms are paywalled and provide little transparency.  
I built this project to leverage open-source models and modern LLMs to make **accurate, transparent, and free resume evaluation** accessible to everyone.
